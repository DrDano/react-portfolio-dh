  ## Description

  ![react-portfolio-demo](./client/src/images/react-portfolio-dh.jpg)

  This application is deployed to Heroku.

  This is my website, I built it to show off some of my projects and skills! Take a look through my projects, peruse my resume, read a bit about me, and if you like what you see, send me an email.

  The front end of this site was built primarily with react.js, and is a single-page-website. React-Bootstrap powers the form and much of the styling. The backend is built entirely on express.js and is primarily there to serve my projects from the github api through a graphql query.
